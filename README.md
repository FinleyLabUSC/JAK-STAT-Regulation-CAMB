Code repository for the manuscript: Dynamic Regulation of JAK-STAT Signaling Through the Prolactin Receptor Predicted by Computational Modeling. doi coming soon.

The R and Matlab directories contain subdirectories which contain all of the necessary code (.R or .m files) to reproduce all findings and figures from the paper. The basic organizational structure is:

* data: contains the data inputs to run a particular analysis
* output: output files of the analysis
* figures: figures generated by the analysis
* cache: any intermediate files required for analysis
